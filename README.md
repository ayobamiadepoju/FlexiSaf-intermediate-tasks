## Current Tasks
1. [**Working with Generics**](https://github.com/ayobamiadepoju/FlexiSaf-intermediate-tasks/tree/main/Working-with-Generics)
    - Demonstrates how to use Java Generics to write type-safe and reusable code.

2. [**Working with Java Collections Framework**](https://github.com/ayobamiadepoju/FlexiSaf-intermediate-tasks/tree/main/Working-with-the-Java-collections-framework)
    - Explores Lists, Sets, Maps, and Iterators.
3. [**Working with Annotations**](https://github.com/ayobamiadepoju/FlexiSaf-intermediate-tasks/tree/main/Using-annotations)
    - Covers how to define custom annotations, apply them to classes and methods, and access annotation data using Java Reflection.

---
## Goals
Build deeper understanding of Java intermediate concepts.
Learn by practicing small but practical coding exercises.
Continuously add more tasks as progress is made.

## Note
This repository will be updated with more tasks over time as new concepts are covered. Stay tuned!
